# Time Taken:
It took me approximately 20 to 24 hours to complete this task.

# What Worked:
- The provided document was extremely helpful as it contained clear instructions.
- The boilerplate code for the application scanner was valuable in understanding the overall flow of the application.

# What Didnâ€™t Work:
- Initially, setting up and running the application took a lot of time. Having clear installation instructions and setup guidelines would have been very useful.
- I first attempted to run the application on a Mac, but due to challenges, I switched to Windows, where I was able to proceed with development more smoothly.
- Although I had limited experience with NAPI and Electron.js, my familiarity with JavaScript and C++ allowed me to quickly adapt and complete the tasks effectively.
- Debugging in Electron.js was initially challenging, but I eventually relied on console logging to complete the tasks successfully.
